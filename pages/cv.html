		<blockquote>I am looking for a part-time job that can help develop my confidence levels and general communication. I feel like I can be quite a confident person but would like to be part of an exterior environment that can help me go that little bit further and help develop me as a person. I have a year’s experience working in retail in a gift store which helped me develop communication skills and key customer service skills. But I would like a part-time job to help me gain further experience alongside my studies in university.</blockquote>

			<h2>ACTIVITIES</h2>
			<blockquote>I am an active person, during secondary school and sixth form I played four sports across different seasons, Rugby, Hockey, Cricket and Football. In my finishing seasons, my school rugby team and I were able to play our way to being regional champions. For hockey I trained twice a week and coached a younger team as well as regular matches, as well as training with my county development team so sport was a big thing for me. I also regularly babysit for local families in my village. Now at university, I am a member of the Mental Health Society which is a topic close to my heart. I also go the to the gym three times a week to stay mentally and physically healthy, along with taking regular walks outdoors with my dog Ruby.</blockquote>
